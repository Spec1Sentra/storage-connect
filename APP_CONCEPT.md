# ChoreSwap: App Concept and Vision

This document outlines the core concept, features, and strategic vision for the ChoreSwap application. It is the foundational blueprint for the MVP development and future roadmap.

## 1. Core Concept

ChoreSwap is a community-powered platform that transforms household chores into engaging, social, and gamified exchanges. It allows users to trade, collaborate on, or pay for tasks using a credit-based economy. The core idea is to leverage psychological triggers‚Äîlike accountability to others, social recognition, and competition‚Äîto make household work enjoyable and rewarding. The app is designed with a "virality-first" approach, focusing on creating a massive, engaged user base before aggressive monetization.

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas

The app will initially target user groups where chore conflicts are most common and where social dynamics can drive rapid adoption.

- **Persona 1: The College Student (e.g., Jason, 21)**
  - **Needs:** A fair way to manage chores in a shared dorm or apartment.
  - **Pain Point:** Hates specific chores (like laundry) and faces constant conflict over who does what.
  - **Motivation:** To swap tasks he dislikes for ones he tolerates, and to have a transparent, fun way to manage household responsibilities with roommates.

- **Persona 2: The Young Professional/Roommates (e.g., Maya, 29)**
  - **Needs:** A way to manage household tasks with a busy work schedule.
  - **Pain Point:** Too exhausted to do chores after work; friction with roommates over unequal contributions.
  - **Motivation:** Willing to swap tasks or pay for help to save time and reduce conflict.

- **Persona 3: The Busy Parent (e.g., Sarah, 36)**
  - **Needs:** Help with the overwhelming number of small, daily tasks.
  - **Pain Point:** Juggling work, childcare, and household duties.
  - **Motivation:** To build a trusted circle of neighborhood parents to swap high-trust tasks like school pickups or grocery runs.

## 3. Core MVP Features

The MVP will focus on establishing the core viral loop: **Post a Chore ‚Üí Swap/Complete ‚Üí Earn Reward ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Attract New Users.**

- **Frictionless Onboarding:**
  - One-tap sign-up using Google (SSO).
  - A quick, optional, and fun "Chore Persona" quiz to engage users immediately.

- **User Profile:**
  - Basic profile with name, photo, and a "Chore Persona" archetype.
  - A visible stat for XP/Level.

- **Chore & Credit Economy:**
  - **Create a Chore:** Users can post a task, giving it a title, description, and a `Chore Level` (1, 2, or 3) which determines its credit value.
  - **Chore Marketplace Feed:** A central feed where users can browse available chores posted by others in their community.
  - **Core Swap Mechanic:** Users can "offer to do" a chore, and the poster can accept the offer. Upon completion, credits are transferred.

- **Verification:**
  - **Photo Proof:** The user completing the chore must upload a photo as proof of completion. The chore poster then verifies it to release the credits.

- **Community Layer (MVP):**
  - **Friend/Household Circles:** Users can create small, private groups (e.g., "Roommates," "Family") to swap chores in a trusted environment.

## 4. Gamification & Engagement (MVP)

- **XP & Leveling System:** Users earn Experience Points (XP) for posting, completing, and verifying chores. Gaining XP allows them to level up, which is displayed on their profile.
- **Badges:** Award simple, automatic badges for initial milestones (e.g., "First Swap," "Laundry Rookie," "Dish Destroyer").
- **Streaks:** A simple counter for consecutive days a user completes a chore.

## 5. Social & Viral Growth Engine

- **Shareable Achievements:** After a chore is completed, generate a simple, shareable image/story ("Jamie just swapped dog-walking for pancakes! ü•ûüêï"). This content is designed for TikTok and Instagram.
- **The Core Viral Loop:** The act of swapping is inherently social. The app will prompt users to invite friends to their "Circles" to make swapping easier and more fun.
- **Referral Rewards:** A simple system: "Invite a friend, and you both get 10 bonus credits."
- **Chore Archetypes:** The results of the onboarding quiz ("You're a Laundry Goblin!") are highly shareable.

## 6. Monetization Strategy (Post-MVP)

Monetization will be introduced only after a critical mass of users is achieved. The initial focus is on growth.

- **Layer 1: Credit Economy:** Users can purchase credit packs with real money (e.g., $0.99 for 10 credits) if they don't have enough from swapping.
- **Layer 2: Premium Subscription:** A monthly subscription that offers perks like:
  - Priority matching for chores.
  - Exclusive avatar/badge customizations.
  - "Streak Insurance" tokens.
- **Layer 3: Marketplace & Partnerships:** Unclaimed chores can be pushed to local businesses for a referral fee. Brands can sponsor challenges or badges.

## 7. Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)

- **Advanced Gamification:** Chore Bidding, Chore Battle Mode, Boss Chores, Power-Ups.
- **Expanded Community Features:** Neighborhood Hubs, public leaderboards, "Chore Squads" (leagues).
- **Advanced Trust & Safety:** AI dishonesty detection, escrow for high-value swaps, skill verification badges.
- **Integrations:** Google Maps for geo-based swapping, Smart Home devices (Alexa/Google Home), and Health/Fitness apps.
- **ChoreCoin:** A potential blockchain layer for a truly global barter economy.
- **AR Mode:** Gamified AR experiences for completing chores.
